## [Project 1A: Building Custom Tables with NYC Real Estate Data](https://public.tableau.com/views/Project1ABuildingCustomTableswithNYCRealEstateData/Sheet3?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

In this project, I was exploring a New York City real estate dataset. Within the dataset, I found records of all buildings and building units sold within New York City over a 12-month period. It was my job to take the data, process it, search for patterns, and create insightful tables to summarize the data.

## [Project 1B: Create Data Visualizations with NYC Real Estate Data](https://public.tableau.com/views/Project1BCreateDataVisualizationswithNYCRealEstateData_17162320364870/Sheet5?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This project is an extension of Project 1A. Previously, I created tables for an NYC real estate investment company. In this project, I was still working for the same real estate investment company but am now focused on creating visualizations to help me determine which neighborhood might be good to invest in. I used skills in preprocessing data, formatting, assigning data types, and adhering to best practices to create visualizations that analyze the New York City real estate dataset.

## [Project 2: Build a Tableau Story with World Bank Data](https://public.tableau.com/views/Project2BuildaTableauStorywithWorldBankData_17164887687790/Story1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

In this project, I was building worksheets, dashboards, and story points â€” to create an analytical story. This project aimed to allow me to take an unfamiliar dataset, explore and analyze the data to discover insights, and then create a Tableau story to highlight my findings. I was exploring a dataset that is almost like a rite of passage for anyone involved in analytics: The World Development Indicators dataset, created and maintained by the World Bank.

Within the data source, I found data related to business, technology, travel, and the population in countries around the world from 2013 through 2019. It was my job to explore these indicators and relay my findings to stakeholders. Specifically, I have just been hired as a data analyst to help start a company that will focus on booking railway travel.

My goal was to make a data-based recommendation as to which country they should select to launch the startup.

## [Project 3: Create Advanced Visualizations with Stock Market Data](https://public.tableau.com/views/Project3CreateAdvancedVisualizationswithStockMarketData_17165827645600/Sheet1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

In this project, I created a dashboard for exploring historical trading prices for a collection of stocks. I was using two datasets, one with stock prices and another with stock symbols for companies on the S&P 500 index. The first dataset consists of daily opening and closing values, high and low values, and the volume of shares traded.
